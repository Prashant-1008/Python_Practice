## 3September2025 - Python Basics (Focused Topics)

This folder covers four focused areas with simple, runnable examples:
- Functions (basics and recursion)
- Parameters (positional, *args, **kwargs, combined)
- Inbuilt functions (commonly used built-ins)
- Decorators (with and without wrappers, with parameters, logging)

### Structure
- `functions/`: Basics of defining and calling functions; recursion walkthrough.
- `parameters/`: Different kinds of arguments and how Python resolves them.
- `inbuiltfunctions/`: Quick demo of useful built-ins.
- `decorators/`: Multiple decorator styles and their effects.

### How to run
From this folder, run any file with Python 3:
```bash
python3 functions/functions.py
python3 functions/recursion.py
python3 parameters/basics.py
python3 parameters/parameters.py
python3 inbuiltfunctions/inbuilt.py
python3 decorators/first.py
```

### Learning outcomes
- Understand function definitions, calls, and return values.
- Use positional, keyword, default, variable-length `*args`/`**kwargs` parameters.
- Get comfortable with built-ins like `len`, `type`, `sum`, `max`, `min`, `abs`.
- Grasp decorators: why wrappers are needed, how to pass arguments, and logging use-cases.
